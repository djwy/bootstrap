# Bootstrap

### Forked from [@berfarah](https://github.com/berfarah)'s lovely setup.

Getting going on my Mac quickly. You can _literally_ copy-paste the below into
your terminal if you really want to.

```sh
bash -c "$(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djwy/bootstrap/master/setup.sh)"
```

Depends on [my dotfiles](https://github.com/djwy/dotfiles).
